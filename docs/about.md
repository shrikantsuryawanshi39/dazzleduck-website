- **High-Speed Execution** — Vectorized query engine optimized for analytical workloads.
- **Lightweight Design** — Minimal setup and memory footprint.
- **SQL-First Approach** — Familiar syntax with analytical capabilities.
- **Open Source** — Fully transparent and community-driven development.

## Core Philosophy

> “Data should be fast, flexible, and fun.”

Dazzle Duck SQL Server was born out of the idea that modern analytics should not require complex setups, expensive infrastructure, or steep learning curves. Instead, it should focus on **developer experience**, **speed**, and **community**.

---

## How It Works

Dazzle Duck follows a **modular query processing pipeline**:

1. **SQL Parsing** → Converts SQL queries into logical plans.  
2. **Optimization** → Applies rule-based and cost-based optimizations.  
3. **Execution** → Runs on a vectorized engine for high throughput.  
4. **Storage & Connectors** → Integrates with CSV, Parquet, DuckDB, PostgreSQL, and more.
